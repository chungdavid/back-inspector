# ðŸ”Ž Back Inspector

### What is it?
Back Inspector is a website where users with back pain can recieve a self-assessment by answering 14 yes/no questions.

### Why did I create it?
I decided to create Back Inspector after reading a book about back pain. It was a way for me to improve my web development skills while reinforcing some of the things I learned from the book. Overall this was a really fun project - it introduced me to webforms, AJAX, and JSON.
